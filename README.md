TODO
-
#### Support for more services like:
- FTP
- GfyCat - API
- Photobucket - API
- Mega(?) - API
- Dropbox(?) - API
- Google Photos (Can't find an API need to do some research)

And probably many more.

#### CLI and GUI application
GUI will probably preview the file with a confirmation box and the unpload it and generally be what a GUI does.

CLI will just upload the file and return the link.
